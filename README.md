# Spotify Data Analysis


## Overview

The music business has gone through, several technology driven shakeups over the past 30 years. The days of ranking songs based on how well
an album or single sold, or how often it was requested on your local radio station is long gone. Music production has vastly changed too, 
with at home recording cheaper than ever, bringing studio level production to people's bedrooms, and social media acting as a primary source
of marketing, artists don't need to sign up for a label to get their music out to listeners. 

Streaming platforms are largely how music is listened to today. Spotify is a Swedish based media streaming platform, founded on 23 April 2006. 
It is the world's largest music streaming service provider, with over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paying subscribers, 
as of September 2021. Spotify streams internationally in over 180 countries as of October 2021. Platforms like Spotify allow almost anyone with 
a musical project to upload their art for everyone in the world to listen to. With so many users, artists, or even single songs, can rack up 
millions, even billions of listens, and Spotify keeps count of each one of them.

## Goal
But what makes a song a hit? It's a question many musicians have asked over the years. Using the dataset below we're hoping to share
some insight by exploring Spotify streaming data from 2016 to 2018.


## Description of Data Source
We'll be preforming our analysis, and answering our questions using these datasets, [Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking/data), and [Spotify Tracks DB](https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db?select=SpotifyFeatures.csv) from Kaggle. 
We'll be looking at the features from the Spotify Tracks DB, such as track duration, energy, danceabilityand more, while comparing and contrasting 
to Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking stream count. We're expecting to find some predictive quality between at least one feature and total streams.

## Work as a Team

Eventhough our goal as a team is to collaborate and help each other on the different tasks, we separated our role as:
* Square: [Brandon Turner](https://github.com/BrandonTur90) will be responsible for the respiratory
* Triangle: [Oluwatobiloba Oduntan](https://github.com/Tobi1018) will create a mockup of a machine learning model.
* Circle: [Roxhensa Kardhiqi](https://github.com/roxhensa02) will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data
* X: [Shantal Jambotkar](https://github.com/shantaljambotkar) will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project and she is working on the Jupiter Notebook and cleaning the data.
